            <h1 class="text-center pt-5"><u>The lineage of the Prophetﷺ</u></h1>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>(From Ibrahim  to Muhammad ﷺ)</strong></p>
              <ul class="pt-4 pl-5">
               <li>The virtue of the lineage of the Prophet ﷺ</li>
                <li>  He is descendant of Ibrahim ࣚ</li>
                 <li> His tribe and family</li>
                  <li>Hunafa in Makah</li>
                   <li>His mother and father</li></ul>
              <p class="pl-5">Allah has honored the Prophet ﷺ with several virtues. Prophet ﷺ is the most honored creations and the last messenger of Allah. His family and ascendants are well known in history. His lineage is passed down through the much-purified way. His ancestors did not touch any kind of adultery. Renowned Hadith scholar Bukhari traces his lineage up to Adnan his twentieth grandfather. Some historians traced back it up to Ibrahim  and some others even up to the first human being Adam .<br>
                The Prophet ﷺ is, without doubt, the descendant of the Prophet Ibrahim . The Prophet Ibrahim  had lived in Ur, a city in the old Mesopotamia (now Iraq). To escape from the persecution of the idolaters he traveled to Palestine where he married a noblewoman Sarah. Many years passed but they were not blessed with children, so Sarah suggested marrying Hagar, her Egyptian maid. He married Hagar and she gave birth to Ismail. Later on, Sarah was blessed with a boy named Ishaq. Allah asked Ibrahim  to take baby Ismael and his mother to the new land later called Makah and he obeyed Allah’s order. Ibrahim  returned to Palestine but made frequent visits to Makah. Allah commanded him to rebuild Ka’bah near Zamzam well where it was first located. Father Ibrahim  and son Ismael  worked hard to build it. They both prayed to Allah to send a Prophet from among their descendants. <br>
                Quran says: <br><strong>
                وَإِذْ يَرْ‌فَعُ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمُ الْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ الْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ رَ‌بَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ﴿ 127﴾ رَ‌بَّنَا وَاجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّ‌يَّتِنَا أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّكَ وَأَرِ‌نَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّ‌حِيمُ ﴿128﴾ رَ‌بَّنَا وَابْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَ‌سُولًا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ﴿128﴾<br><br></strong>
                And (remember) when Ibrahim and (his son) Isma'il were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah), (saying), "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”, "Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our Manasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage - Hajj and Umrah, etc.), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. "Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own (and indeed Allah answered their invocation by sending Muhammadﷺ), who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Quran) and Al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. Verily! You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise."<br>
                Ismael's  sons increased in Makah. His descendants deployed all over Arabia. Adnan was one of the descendants of the Prophet Ismail  from whom most of the Arab tribes descended. ‘Quraish’ was a prominent Arab tribe in the sixth century, which was belonged to Adnan. They always lived near Ka’bah. Aws and Khazraj were the prominent tribes of Madina<br>

              <p class="pl-5">Nearly the break of dawn on Monday, 12th of Rabeeul Awwal, equivalent to 20 April 571 AD, the Prophet ﷺ was born in the house of Abu Talib in Makah. Some Hadith books reported that the light was shined from the birthplace that enlightened the palaces of Sham. <br>
                At first, the mother Aminah breastfed the newborn, then Thuwaibah took care of feeding for a while. After that, he was sent to famous and noble wet-nurse Halimah .<br>
                
                Arabs living in towns usually were sending their children to wet nurses in faraway desert areas. The purpose was to bring up them in free and healthy environments with pure language. The woman Halimah al-Sadiyah  from Banu Saa'd tribe was assigned to take care of the newborn Muhammad ﷺ.  After taking him, Halimah and her family were graced by continuous good fortunes. Her breasts swelled with milk, the dry grassland turned fresh and green. Her weak donkey got stronger and robust. <br> 
                Cleaving the chest <br>
                In his childhood, an important incident took place in Halimah’s house. When the boy was left alone in the yard, the two angels appeared in front of him, cleaved his chest, and took out the heart.  They mixed it with some water and returned it to the same place. The hadith book Muslim reports: <br>
                <strong> ثُمَّ غَسَلَهُ فِي طَسْتٍ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ بِمَاءِ زَمْزَم، ثُمَّ لَأَمَهُ ثُمَّ أَعَادَهُ فِي مَكَانِهِ.</strong>  <br>
                Then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a gold basin. After that, the heart was joined together and was restored to its place.  <br>
                Later Anas  reported that he has repeatedly seen the mark of the cleaving in the chest of the Prophet ﷺ.  <br>
                His foster brother ran to Halima and said what happened to little Muhammad. Haleema confirmed that he is fine. Very shortly after this incident, she returned him to Amina, his mother. <br>

                   </ul>
              <p class="pl-5"><strong>Beginning of the Wahy:</strong> <br> When the Prophet ﷺ reached approximately 40 years old, he used to go cave Hira and worship Allah according to the religion of Ibrahim . Hira cave was located two miles away from Makah. In Ramadan, he took special care to spend his time in the cave. It is reported that he went to Hira and worshipped there for three years. The first Wahy was revealed in cave Hira.<br>
                In a long narration, we can see the explanation of Aisha  about the first revelation.<br> 
                Bukhari says:<br>
                The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright daylight. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship (Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay. One day,  suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. <br>
                Bukhari continues:<br>
                The angel Jibreel came down and said to the Prophet ﷺ:<br> 
                اقْرَأْ
                 “Read”
                The Prophet ﷺ replied,<br>
                مَا أَنَا بِقَارِئٍ 
                "I do not know how to read."<br>
                The Prophet ﷺ added<br>
                فَأَخَذَنِي فَغَطَّنِي حَتَّى بَلَغَ مِنِّي الْجَهْدَ، ثُمَّ أَرْسَلَنِي<br>
                The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me<br> 
                Jibreel caught him three times. After releasing him Jibreel told:<br>
                } اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ} خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ} اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ا<br>
                 "Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous. Who taught (the man) by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not.<br>  
                Upon revealing the first Wahy, he was terrified. He went to Khadija and told:<br>
                 زَمِّلُونِي<br>
                "Cover me! Cover me!"<br>
                She covered him till his fear was over and then he said, <br>
                "O Khadija, what is wrong with me?" <br>
                He narrated everything that happened and said,<br> 
                'I fear that something may happen to me."<br>
                Khadija replied:<br>
                كَلاَّ وَاللَّهِ مَا يُخْزِيكَ اللَّهُ أَبَدًا، إِنَّكَ لَتَصِلُ الرَّحِمَ، وَتَحْمِلُ الْكَلَّ، وَتَكْسِبُ الْمَعْدُومَ، وَتَقْرِي الضَّيْفَ، وَتُعِينُ عَلَى نَوَائِبِ الْحَقِّ‏.<br>
                Never! (But have the glad tidings) By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, <br>

                   </ul>
              <p class="pl-5"><strong>Open Call</strong> <br>After three years of the Prophethood, Allah sent down the verse<br>
                وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الْأَقْرَبِين<br>
                "And warn your nearest tribe”<br> 
                In this verse, Allah ordered the prophet to begin the assigned task by calling his own family towards Islam. Obeying Allah's order, he assembled his family and tribe and addressed them. He made an eloquent speech: <br>
                إِنَّ الرَّائِدَ لا يَكْذِبُ أَهْلَهُ . وَاللَّهِ لَوْ كَذَبْتُ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا مَا كَذَبْتُكُمْ ، وَلَوْ غَرَرْتُ النَّاسَ مَا غَرَرْتُكُمْ ، وَاللَّهِ الَّذِي لا إِلَهَ إِلا هُوَ ، إِنِّي لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ خَاصَّةً وَإِلَى النَّاسِ كَافَّةً ، وَاللَّهِ لَتَمُوتُنَّ كَمَا تَنَامُونَ ، وَلَتُبْعَثُنَّ كَمَا تَسْتَيْقِظُونَ ، وَلَتُحَاسَبُنَّ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ ، وَلَتُجْزَوُنَّ بِالإِحْسَانِ إِحْسَانًا<br>
                A guide can never lie to his people. I swear by Allah, there is no god but He, that I have been sent as a Messenger to you in particular and to all the people in general. I swear by Allah you will die just as you sleep, you will be resurrected just as you wake up. You will be called to account for your deeds. It is then either Hell forever or the Garden (Paradise) forever."<br>
                His tribe Quraish heard to his speech but there were no major replies from them except from his two uncles. His one uncle Abu Lahab asked Quraish to stop Muhammad ﷺ form preaching new religion while another uncle Abu Talib offered every help and protection to him.<br>
                After a while, the following verse revealed:<br>
                 فَاصْدَعْ بِمَا تُؤْمَرُ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْمُشْرِكِينَ <br>
                Therefore proclaim openly that which you are commanded, and turn away from Al-Mushrikun (polytheists)." [15:94] <br>
                Then he climbed the Mount Safa and called each tribe in Makah with their names one by one. He asked them:<br>
                أرَأَيْتَكُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلاً بِالْوَادِي تُرِيدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ، أَكُنْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ<br>
                "Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?"<br>
                They said<br>
                نَعَمْ، مَا جَرَّبْنَا عَلَيْكَ إِلاَّ صِدْقًا.<br> 
                Yes, we have never experienced any lie from you."<br>
                Then the Prophet ﷺ said<br>
                فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ<br>
                "I am a warner to you before a severe torment."<br> 
                Abu Lahab suddenly remarked:<br> 
                تَبًّا لَكَ سَائِرَ الْيَوْمِ، أَلِهَذَا جَمَعْتَنَا فنزلت:  تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ<br> 
                He said: "Woe be to you all day, you gathered us for these words?! At that time, the following verses were revealed: (May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he”<br>

              <p class="pl-5"><strong>Persecution of Muslims:</strong> <br>In addition to their attempt to degrade the Prophet ﷺ by accusations, Quraish also decided to persecute early Muslim converts. They put early Muslims in different sorts of tortures. Because of the dignity and gravity of the Prophet ﷺ, they couldn't make any serious injury to him. Only top leaders of Quraish such as Abu Lahab, Abu Jahl and Uqbat bin Mueet were dared enough to torture the Prophet ﷺ.<br>
                Bilal was a slave and brutally tortured by his master Umayah for embracing Islam. The street children were dragging him by a rope that was put on his neck. A huge rock was put on his chest to force him to go back to polytheism. But he kept saying Ahad.. Ahad .<br>
                Khabbab bin Al Arth was also a slave and his mistress was torturing her by placing the hot iron on his back.<br> 
                Most of the slaves are freed by Abu Bakr . His father admonished him that he is freeing the weak slaves, if he had freed some strong persons, they would have protected him. Allah indicated to the generosity of Abu Bakr in the following verse:<br>
                وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الْأَتْقَى17} الَّذِي يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّى18} وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَى19} إِلَّا ابْتِغَاء وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الْأَعْلَى20} }<br>
                But the righteous one will avoid it (hellfire) - (17) [He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself (18) And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded (19) But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High.<br>
                Ammar, his mother Sumayya and his father Yasir were brutally tortured for accepting Islam. Ammar was taken to the desert and beaten up under the hot sun. His mother Sumayya whom Abu Jahl killed by inserting a spear into her body was the first martyr in Islam. Yasir also passed away because of the torture. On seeing this maltreatment of Yasir family, the Prophet ﷺ said<br>
                صَبْرًا يَا آلَ يَاسِرٍ فَإِنَّ مَوْعِدَكُمُ الْجَنَّةُ <br>
                "Be patient Oh family of Yasir, you will verily find your abode in the Paradise."<br>
                Persecutions of the Prophet ﷺ<br>
                Abu Lahab and his wife Ummu Jameel were leading the brutal campaign against him. She once threw bundles of thorns in the paths where the Prophet ﷺ usually walked. Allah has called her 'carrier of firewood' in the Quran.<br>

              <p class="pl-5"><strong>Intensification of persecution:</strong> <br>They found the Prophet ﷺ is committed to doing Islamic preaching and nothing can dissuade him from it. Their attempt to degrade Islam in Ethiopia failed. Now they intensified torture to the bearer of the message Prophet ﷺ.<br>
                They even tried to make a major injury to his body. Once Abu Jahl told his people: I will carry a heavy rock and drop it on Muhammad's head while he is performing Sujood. I don't care how Abdu Manaf clan might retaliate to me" Next day he went to the Prophet ﷺ when he was praying. Quraish were watching the scene. Soon Abu Jahl came back scared. He said: When I approached I saw an unusual camel with dreadful canines coming to me to eat" The Prophet ﷺ commented on this incident: <br>
                " ذَاكَ جِبْرِيلُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ لَوْ دَنَا مِنِّي لأَخَذَهُ " .
                That was Jibreel and if he had approached closer, Jibreel would have killed him.<br>
                ‘Urwah bin Az-Zubair narrated: I asked Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al-‘As to tell me of the worst thing that the pagans did to the Prophet ﷺ. He said: "While the Prophet ﷺ was praying in Al-Hijr of Al-Ka’bah, ‘Uqbat bin Al-Mueet came and put his garment around the Prophet’s neck and throttled him violently. Abu Bakr came and caught him by his shoulder. Then he pushed him away from the Prophet ﷺ and said:<br>
                <br>تَقْتُلُونَ رَجُلًا أَنْ يَقُولَ رَبِّيَ اللَّهُ وَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ مِنْ رَبِّكُم
                <br>"Do you want to kill a man just because he says, My Lord is Allah? He has come to you with clear pieces of evidence from your lord”<br>
                Upon this, they started beating Abu baker so much so that he lost his conscience.  His family took him to his house. They thought he died, but later in the evening, he woke up. Then he was offered water and food. He refused to take any food and drink until he sees the Prophet ﷺ. When they took him to the Prophet ﷺ in the night, he confirmed that the Prophet ﷺ is fine and began to eat.<br>
                Abu Bakr also had prepared to migrate to Ethiopia, but a Quraish leader gave asylum to him on the condition that he should not involve in any Islamic activity in public. He kept his prayers in the house for some time, but later he performed it in public. When the Quraish leader reminded him of his asylum, he told<br>
                إِنِّي أَرُدُّ إِلَيْكَ جِوَارَكَ وَأَرْضَى بِجِوَارِ اللَّهِ<br>
                I don’t want your protection, I am satisfied with the shelter of Allah and his messenger.<br>

              <p class="pl-5">The miracle of the splitting the moon</strong> <br>The pagan Waleed bin Mugheerah and some Quraish people challenged the Prophet ﷺ that if Muhammad ﷺ is the real Prophet of Allah, then he should split the moon into two. <br>
                The Prophet ﷺ accepted the challenge. <br>
                “If I do it, will you become Muslims?” <br>
                The polytheists answered: <br>
                “Yes, we will.” <br>
                Allah split the moon into two on a full moon night. The Prophet ﷺ told to Quraish: <br>
                “Bear witness! (i.e. look at the sky and witness how Allah has split the moon) <br> 
                However, the polytheists answered, “This is one of the magic of Abu Kabsha’s Son.” <br> 
                Quran refers to this incident in the following verses: <br>
                اقْتَرَ‌بَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ‌ ﴿١﴾ وَإِن يَرَ‌وْا آيَةً يُعْرِ‌ضُوا وَيَقُولُوا سِحْرٌ‌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ <br>‌
                The Hour has come near, and the moon has split [in two]. (1) <br>
                Quraish saw the split moon directly. They couldn’t believe their eyes, so they asked the people around them to confirm it. Everybody confirmed it. <br>
                <strong>Islam being introduced to Arabian Tribes and Individuals</strong> <br>
                The Prophet ﷺ used to intensify his mission in the Haj season. He called both individuals and tribes to Islam. But there was no major change or conversion to Islam reported in this period except the conversion of some of the prominent persons. Among them was the leader of Gifari tribe Abu Dhar.   <br>
                The tribe Gifari lived near to Medina. Abu Dhar, the leader of the tribe learned about the appearance of a new religion in Makah.  He sent his brother Anis to get more info about it. But he was not satisfied in brother's report and he prepared to leave for Makah. Then brother warned about the people of Makah. <br> 
                Abu Dhar arrived Makah in search of the Prophet ﷺ. He couldn't identify the Prophet ﷺ and Muslims. He exercised great caution and didn't ask anyone. In the night Ali  noticed him as a stranger, so invited to his house. Two nights he spent in Ali's house, but both didn't exchange their identity. On the third night, Ali  asked his identity. He revealed the purpose. Ali  was pleased to hear it. Next day he went with Ali  to the Prophet ﷺ and embraced Islam. The Prophet ﷺ asked him not to reveal it in public, but Abu Dhar publically announced Shahada (كَلِمَة الشهَادَة) in Ka’bah. Quraish started beating him until Abbas  rescued him. He justified that Quraish caravans usually pass through Gifari's territory and if Abu Dhar is killed, definitely Gifari tribe will put Quraish caravans in danger.  <br>
                He returned to his tribe with the new religion and eventually a large number of his tribe embraced Islam. <br>
